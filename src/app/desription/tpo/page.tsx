          Dear Recruiters, The Training and Placement Cell of the Central Institute
          of Technology Kokrajhar serves as a bridge between academia and industry,
          facilitating a seamless transition for our students into the professional
          realm. We understand the pivotal role that recruiters play in identifying
          and harnessing talent, and we are eager to forge lasting partnerships that
          benefit both our students and your organization. CIT Kokrajhar is a center
          of skills, innovation, and human resource development, focusing especially
          on fulfilling the needs of vocational and technical education in the
          Bodoland Territorial Region. I am glad to inform you that the majority of
          students at this institute are from BTR and NE India, with a good number of
          students from other states of India too. CIT is mandated to impart technical
          and vocational education, such as Information Technology, Construction
          Technology, Food Processing Technology, Electronics and Communication
          Engineering, Instrumentation Engineering, Multimedia Communication and
          Design, etc.

          CIT started its first batch of students with a Diploma module in 2006 and
          has now grown into a Deemed to be University offering BTech/BDes/MTech/MDes/PhD
          programs in various departments. I would like to remind you all that it is
          next to impossible to live and cope up with the present-day world without
          technical knowledge. So, to help society and the country, we still need many
          young technical graduates and researchers. While we have IITs, NITs, IISc,
          and other institutes of national importance in the country, institutes like
          CIT Kokrajhar fulfill the aspirations and needs of many underprivileged
          students and students from remote places. Since assuming my additional charge
          as the Director of CIT Kokrajhar, I have come to know that many of our alumni
          are pursuing MTech and PhD in IISc/IITs and abroad, and that many are placed
          in various prestigious positions in the industry. These achievements are the
          pride of CIT Kokrajhar, and we can learn a lot from these accomplishments of
          the alumni.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p style={{ textAlign: "justify", fontSize: "1rem", lineHeight: "1.6" }}>
          I encourage you to explore the detailed profiles of our students, the academic
          programs we offer, and the various success stories that highlight the caliber
          of talent that emerges from CIT Kokrajhar. We look forward to the opportunity
          to welcome your organization to our campus, providing a platform for meaningful
          interactions between your representatives and our aspiring young professionals.
